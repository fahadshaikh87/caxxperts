# caxxperts Task


Create a program with VB.NET or C # that reads the text file, recognizes the numbers and displays them on the screen. It is up to you whether you implement a console,
desktop or WPF application.

The spacing (number of spaces) is not always the same between the individual numbers because the file was created manually
